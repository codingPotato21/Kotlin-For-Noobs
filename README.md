# Kotlin For Noobs - Course Examples and Mini-Projects Repo
## by: codingPotato ♥️

Here you can find the examples and projects we do together in our lectures. You can download the whole project and use it or you can view the code by going to the `src/main/kotlin` folder and copy what you like. Each class has an individual example and they are labled by the lecture number followed by example number ex: `Lecture3Ex1` for the first example done during lecture 3 video on youtube.

## How To Clone The Project

#### [Step 1] Clone The Repo

You have two options here: Either you download the code from the github as a `.zip` file and extract it then place the project somewhere on your computer while keeping note of the location where you place it. Or use the commands as explained below.

To use the terminal of command-prompt method, open a terminal and run these commands. Kindly note, the directory where you open the termianl is where the application folder will be placed. When you open the application folder to import in in intellij it will be at this specific location.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/codingPotato21/Kotlin-For-Noobs
```

#### [Step 2] Import The Project in Intellij 

Now that you have the code downloaded and in a folder. Open Intellij and do the following steps:

1- Launch IntelliJ IDEA.
- If the Welcome screen opens, click Open.
- Otherwise, from the main menu, select File | Open.

2- In the dialog that opens, select the directory in which your sources, libraries, and other assets are located and click Open.

3- When you import or clone a project for the first time, IntelliJ IDEA analyzes it. If the IDE detects more than one configuration (for example, Eclipse and Gradle), it prompts you to select which configuration you want to use.

- Important: If the project that you are importing uses a build tool, such as Maven or Gradle, we recommend that you select the build tool configuration (We use Gradle in this project so select that).
- Select the necessary configuration and click OK.
- The IDE pre-configures the project according to your choice. For example, if you select Gradle, IntelliJ IDEA executes its build scripts, loads dependencies, and so on.

4- If you have been working with another project, select whether you want to open the new project in a new dialog or in the current one.
